# Chess_Games_Analysis
DSC 680 Project 3
Chess is a game that has existed for a long time and is played all over the world. It is a very complex and complicated game, as a single game of chess can have as many permutations as 10^120 (Wikipedia). While a game that is as complex as it is there are very strategic openings that can be played to better your chances of winning. During my analysis we will analyze a variety of games played by different players of FIDE level and titles and different time constraints of rapid or blitz. We will come up with a list of top openings played by these games with the best winning rate for players playing with white or black pieces.
